## Capstone Project Portfolio

**Description**: This is the project portfolio for my Senior Project, spanning two semesters.  

For this project, I was tasked by my employer to develop a new web-based user interface to operate a scanner that utilizes quantitative transmisson ultra sound to aid in the detection of breast cancer.  

Though there were many challenges in developing this new version of a user interface, the final result shows a significant improvement in both asthetic and performance when compared to the previous interface.
